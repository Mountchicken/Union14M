# Projects

The OpenMMLab ecosystem can only grow through the contributions of the community.
Everyone is welcome to post their implementation of any great ideas in this folder! If you wish to start your own project, please go through the [example project](example_project/) for the best practice. For common questions about projects, please read our [faq](faq.md).

## External Projects

Here we lists some selected external projects released in the community built upon MMOCR:

- [TableMASTER-mmocr](https://github.com/JiaquanYe/TableMASTER-mmocr)
- [WordArt](https://github.com/xdxie/WordArt)

Note: The core maintainers of MMOCR only ensure the results are reproducible and the code quality meets its claim at the time each project was submitted, but they may not be responsible for future maintenance. The original authors take responsibility for maintaining their own projects.
