## Introduction

MMOCR is an open-source toolbox based on PyTorch and mmdetection for text detection, text recognition, and the corresponding downstream tasks including key information extraction. It is part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The main branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.

</div>

### Major Features

- **Comprehensive Pipeline**

  The toolbox supports not only text detection and text recognition, but also their downstream tasks such as key information extraction.

- **Multiple Models**

  The toolbox supports a wide variety of state-of-the-art models for text detection, text recognition and key information extraction.

- **Modular Design**

  The modular design of MMOCR enables users to define their own optimizers, data preprocessors, and model components such as backbones, necks and heads as well as losses. Please refer to [Getting Started](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for how to construct a customized model.

- **Numerous Utilities**

  The toolbox provides a comprehensive set of utilities which can help users assess the performance of models. It includes visualizers which allow visualization of images, ground truths as well as predicted bounding boxes, and a validation tool for evaluating checkpoints during training.  It also includes data converters to demonstrate how to convert your own data to the annotation files which the toolbox supports.

## What's New

### üíé Stable version

v0.6.1 was released in 2022-08-04.

1. ArT dataset is available for text detection and recognition!
2. Fix several bugs that affects the correctness of the models.
3. Thanks to [MIM](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim), our installation is much simpler now! The [docs](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) has been renewed as well.

Read [Changelog](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html) for more details!

### üåü Preview of 1.x version

A brand new version of **MMOCR v1.0.0rc0** was released in 2022-09-01:

1. **New engines**. MMOCR 1.x is based on [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine), which provides a general and powerful runner that allows more flexible customizations and significantly simplifies the entrypoints of high-level interfaces.

2. **Unified interfaces**. As a part of the OpenMMLab 2.0 projects, MMOCR 1.x unifies and refactors the interfaces and internal logics of train, testing, datasets, models, evaluation, and visualization. All the OpenMMLab 2.0 projects share the same design in those interfaces and logics to allow the emergence of multi-task/modality algorithms.

3. **Cross project calling**. Benefiting from the unified design, you can use the models implemented in other OpenMMLab projects, such as MMDet. We provide an example of how to use MMDetection's Mask R-CNN through `MMDetWrapper`. Check our documents for more details. More wrappers will be released in the future.

4. **Stronger visualization**. We provide a series of useful tools which are mostly based on brand-new visualizers. As a result, it is more convenient for the users to explore the models and datasets now.

5. **More documentation and tutorials**. We add a bunch of documentation and tutorials to help users get started more smoothly. Read it [here](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/).

## Installation

MMOCR depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) and [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
Below are quick steps for installation.
Please refer to [Install Guide](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for more detailed instruction.

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.8 pytorch=1.10 cudatoolkit=11.3 torchvision -c pytorch -y
conda activate open-mmlab
pip3 install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
mim install mmdet
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr.git
cd mmocr
pip3 install -e .
```
